<samp>Hi there! Nice to meet you! I'm Eva and I'm a Junior Frontend developer always willing to improve my skills. Most of my working life I've been a media director, but in 2020 I turned my life upside down 🙃 and became frontend developer at <a href="https://adalab.es/">Adalab</a> 🤓. Right now, I'm loving my first job as a frontend developer thanks to the team at <a href="http://soamee.com/">Soamee</a> 💜, learning and developing in React Native 📱. If you think I can help you with anything, just let me know. I'll be glad to do my best!</samp>
